Continuously, the Hardening Framework improves its framework to cover up-to-date server hardening. [Sebastian Gumprich](https://github.com/rndmh3ro) and [Anton Lugovoi](https://github.com/fitz123) did an amazing job to improve the Ansible implementation for os-hardening and ssh-hardening. Core focus of the last release was to improve and ease the installation via [Ansible Galaxy](https://galaxy.ansible.com/).

For [os-hardening](https://github.com/hardening-io/ansible-os-hardening):

 * Fix a bug in the passwdqc template (#51)
 * Change directory layout so the role is easily installable from ansible-galaxy (#49)
 * Improved travis-tests to cover more cases (#42)
 * Fix passwdqc default options (#44)
 * Remove duplicate "update pam" task (#46)
 * Fix stuck in case pam files was updated before by force update (#45)
 * Fix nologin shell path (#44)

For [ssh-hardening](https://github.com/hardening-io/ansible-ssh-hardening):

 * adds more tests (#42)
 * support for sftp-enabling (#41
 * and a new directory layout, making the role easily installable from ansible-galaxy (#44).

The Hardening Framework is also available for Chef and Puppet. Be sure to follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/hardening_io) for the latest updates.
